# NextPlay
## Predicting the upcoming play in NFL games
NextPlay is a web app that uses machine learning to predict what the next play will be in a football game. This is useful tool for:
- Coaches
- Sports Betting
- Fans

To build this app I used a data set found on kaggle: [source](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016/data).

## How to use NextPlay?
You can navigate to the website [here](http://nextplay.life/). There are two main uses: Live Play Prediction and the Prediction Tool.
Live Play Prediction will give live predictions for the next play in live games. The Prediction Tool allows the user to enter
various game situations (or click random for a random situation) in order to view predictions and perhaps learn more about the game 
of football! I hope you have fun using this app!

## What's in this repo?
In this repo is a jupyter notebook summarizing my analysis, as well as python scripts that were useful to train models and plot results. Soon I will also upload my flask app scripts.
